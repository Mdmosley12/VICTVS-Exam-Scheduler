# VICTVS Event Scheduler

This is my Event Scheduler which has been created using **NextJS**.
It has been hosted on Vercel and can be viewed here:

The user is able to sort the exam list by **Title**, **Candidate**, **Date** or **Location** by clicking on the corresponding category title.

There are also two drop down menus and a date selector, allowing the user to filter the exam list by **Candidate**, **Date** or **Location**.
